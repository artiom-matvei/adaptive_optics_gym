# Adaptive Optics Reinforcement Learning Gym

This code corresponds to our IJCAI 2023 AI And Social Good submission. It includes:

- A list of required packages to run the code;
- A simulated satellite-to-ground communication environment for training reinforcement learning to control a deformable mirror in a wavefront sensorless adaptive optics system;
- The models trained on the environment;
- Instructions on how to install, instantiate and use the RL environment and train a model
